# Web Chat Samples

This folder contains various javascript examples related to the Xenioo Web Chat Channel initialization, configuration and interaction with your page. Check the list below for a brief explanation of each example

# formatting text
Web chat widget allows you to format any text coming out from any Content Action (Text Action, Carousel, ...).  
[See format specification](https://github.com/xenioo/Snippets/blob/master/Web%20Chat/Formatting%20text.md)

# callback_events_example
This example shows all of the different callback function you can attach to the Xenioo web chat object instance. You can access anything form basic chat objects to user interactions. You can see a [live demo here](https://www.xenioo.com/showcase/events-log/).

# initialize_with_variables
This simple initialization file contains a small variation of the standard script that will initialize your chatbot conversation by injecting a variable. As the new conversation starts, the variable is automatically valued and can be used right away. If the injected variable does not exist, it will be created.  
By injecting variables from the page, you can for example tell your chatbot the currently logged username, the contents of the current shopping cart or the current page info so that it can give meaningful and contextual information.

# referrer_activation
You can use this example if your chatbot needs to activate only when the page is coming from a specific link. If you need to activate your chatbot only on specific pages, you can use alter the script to use window.location.href instead of document.referrer.

# reset_user_conversation
Each Xenioo chatbot use local cookie to track users and recognize them every time they land on the site. If you need to reset the user conversation, you can simply delete the local cookie associated with the bot. Keep in mind that resetting that cookie means that the next time the user will reload the page it will be counted as a new user in the conversation history.

# user_ip_informations
In this example page we're using <a href='http://geobytes.com/iplocator/'>GeoBytes</a> free service to detect the current user ip and pass to our chatbot the detected country and location. The chatbot will be activated automatically as the ip check is done. This sample can be easily adapted to use different kind of ip-location services.

# home_page_different_activation
Activate Xenioo chatbot differently, depending on your current web page. In the example, the chatbot will automatically open in full, depending on Xenioo configuration, on the homepage while staying closed on any other page.

# start_with_behaviour
Activate Xenioo chatbot starting from specific behavior. Just pass to the initialization script the behavior's API TOKEN you can find in the Behavior properties panel into the flow designer.
